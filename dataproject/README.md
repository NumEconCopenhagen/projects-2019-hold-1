The dataproject uses data from Danish Corporate Data. First it analyzes danish corporate data. We show how to organize, filter and create an overview of the data. In addition, we perform certain calculations on the data set and show how to analyse distributional results using the data.  Lastly, we analyse the data showing how to interactively ascess the data and perform certain filtrations and calculations on the data. Lastly, we show how to merge datasets and perform regression analysis between the data to look for correlations and relations in the data set.
